# iPhone Reliability Test Report — v11.1

## ★ Device-verified acceptance results (2026-07-11)

**25-cycle record→save→transcribe matrix — PHYSICAL iPhone 14 Pro, iOS 26.5,
Release build, native Apple Speech engine (run 1, hands-free via MG_SELFTEST):**

- startedAt 17:57:48Z → finishedAt 18:06:36Z (8.8 min)
- **25/25 cycles saved playable audio** (verified byte counts 257–274 KB per 20s cycle)
- **25/25 cycles auto-transcribed to `complete`** (acceptance requires ≥24/25)
- ~21.1s per cycle: 20s recording + ~1s native transcription
  (Whisper-WASM took 25–40s per 20s segment and crashed the WebView)
- Zero crashes across the entire run; app process alive throughout
- Evidence: `selftest-results.json` pulled from the device via devicectl
  (machine-generated metrics only)

**Run 2 (kill-recovery variant):** fresh run confirmed live (4 cycles PASS),
force-quit fired mid-cycle-5 via devicectl; run checkpointed. Resumes
automatically at next unlock (screen auto-locked when the kill released the
app's wake lock — iOS blocks launches while locked).

# Historical: v10.0 report

**Device:** David's iPhone XIV — iPhone 14 Pro (iPhone15,2), iOS 26.5
**Build type:** Release (`xcodebuild -configuration Release`, automatic signing, team NDZXSR63GJ)
**App version:** v10.0 (commit — see git log)
**Honesty labels:** each result is marked `build-verified`, `preview-verified`
(desktop browser at 390×844, IndexedDB backend, same TS code paths), or
`device-verified` (ran on the physical iPhone). Only device-verified results
count toward the acceptance criteria.

## Verification already performed by the agent

| What | Result | Evidence level |
|---|---|---|
| Web build + oxlint | pass | build-verified |
| iOS Release build incl. FreeDiskPlugin.swift (arm64) | pass | build-verified |
| Android assembleDebug | pass | build-verified |
| Meeting record exists the moment recording starts | pass (`status:'recording'` in History ~1s after tap) | preview-verified |
| 60s segment rotation writes+verifies during recording | pass (seg-0, 966KB at t=60s, recording continued) | preview-verified |
| Kill (reload) mid-recording at t≈78s | pass — BOTH segments survived (pagehide flush caught the 17s tail); recovery chip + Retry + playable audio after relaunch | preview-verified |
| Disk reconciliation on relaunch | pass (`recover.recording: segsOnDisk=2, segsBelieved=2`) | preview-verified |
| Multi-segment transcription, boundary stitching | pass (2 segments, 594 chars, verbatim, no dup/loss at boundary) | preview-verified |
| Kill mid-transcription at checkpoint tNext=1 | pass — part 1 transcript survived; status `transcription_interrupted at 2/2 — resumable` | preview-verified |
| Resume from checkpoint | pass (`transcribe.start from:1`; only segment 2 re-processed; final transcript identical to uninterrupted run) | preview-verified |
| Saved-vs-transcribed distinction | pass ("Recording safely saved — 00:18, 0.3 MB in 3 segments…" banner; separate transcription state) | preview-verified |
| Storage display while recording | pass ("3.1 GB free" chip; native path uses FreeDiskPlugin — needs device run) | preview-verified |
| Contrast / 5-tab mobile nav / no clipping at 390pt | pass (screenshots) | preview-verified |
| Install + launch Release build on iPhone 14 Pro (iOS 26.5) | pass (devicectl install + launch, process confirmed) | **device-verified** |
| Recording on device → segmented save (81s → 2 segments, dur 01:21) | pass (owner screenshot 2026-07-11 07:38) | **device-verified** |
| Recording survives a REAL transcription crash — audio playable, "interrupted — resumable" chip, Retry button (the core zero-loss criterion) | pass (07:34 recording, 11s, player functional after crash) | **device-verified** |
| Live per-segment progress on device ("Transcribing 2/2 — 100%") | pass (owner screenshot) | **device-verified** |
| Segmented player with part label (1/2) on device | pass (owner screenshot) | **device-verified** |

## Bugs found on device (fixed in v10.1)

1. **App exits to home screen when transcription fails** — WKWebView process
   crash during Whisper inference (suspected OOM). The save-first architecture
   contained it (audio + state intact, resumable). v10.1 mitigations: 20s
   inference windows (lower peak memory), single-thread WASM pinned,
   transferable audio buffers, auto-resume on relaunch with a crash-safe
   attempt counter (max 2 automatic attempts — a deterministic crash cannot
   loop). Root cause needs the on-device diagnostics export.
2. **Text overflow with Display Zoom / large Dynamic Type** — headings wrapped
   vertically, status chips clipped off-screen. v10.1: headings scale down at
   ≤480/360pt, meta rows wrap, chips wrap instead of clip.

## Known limitations (honest)

1. A hard force-quit can lose up to the last 60 s (in-flight segment). Lock/
   background triggers an immediate flush, so the practical loss window is
   seconds. Verified zero-loss on reload-kill in preview; device behavior on
   true force-quit must be confirmed (test 11).
2. Background recording relies on iOS honoring `UIBackgroundModes: audio` for
   WKWebView getUserMedia. If iOS suspends anyway, completed segments are safe
   and the app reports the interruption — it does not pretend to keep recording.
3. On-device summaries need WebGPU (unavailable in WKWebView): phone flow is
   transcript-always, summary via optional BYO Claude key.
4. Imported files are stored as a single segment; a multi-hour import is
   decoded in one piece (recordings are always ≤60 s pieces). 25-min+ imports
   untested on device.
5. Memory-growth across repeated recordings (test 20) requires Xcode
   instrumentation on the device; not measurable in preview.
